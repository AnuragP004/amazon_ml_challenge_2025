# Models Directory

This directory contains trained model weights and checkpoints.

## Model Files

- `best_model.pth` - Best performing multimodal model weights
- Model checkpoints are generated during training
- Pretrained models (DistilBERT, MobileNetV2) are downloaded automatically

## Note

Trained model files are not included in this repository due to size constraints.
Run the training notebooks to generate model weights.
